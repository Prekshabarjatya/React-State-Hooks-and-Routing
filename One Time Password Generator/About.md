## About This Project

In this project, I built an OTP generator using React functional components and hooks. I learned how to manage state with `useState`, handle side effects with `useEffect`, and work safely with timers in React. I practiced conditional rendering, controlled UI elements (like disabling the button during the countdown), and improved accessibility with `aria-live`. Generating 6-digit OTPs, updating the countdown, and styling the component helped me strengthen my frontend skills and focus on user experience.
