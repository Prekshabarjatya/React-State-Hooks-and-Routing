## Brief: What I Learned from the Event RSVP Project

- Built a React RSVP form using only controlled components.
- Managed state for text, email, number, and checkbox inputs.
- Practiced form validation using `required` and `min` attributes.
- Used conditional rendering to show a confirmation message after submit.
- Displayed each fieldâ€™s value clearly after submission for feedback and testing.
- Strengthened my understanding of React form handling, input control, and simple component-based UI design.
