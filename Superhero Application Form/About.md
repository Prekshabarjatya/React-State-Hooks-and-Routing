## What I Learned From Building SuperheroForm

- Explored how to use React's `useState` for managing form field state individually for text, password, select, and checkboxes.
- Learned to implement controlled components for user input—each field’s value is tied to state and updated via `onChange`.
- Used arrays to dynamically generate dropdown options and multiple checkboxes with `.map()`.
- Mastered handling grouped checkbox state using an array, with `includes`, spread, and filter for adding/removing items.
- Improved form validation and UX by disabling the submit button until all required fields are filled and at least one checkbox is selected.
- Practiced clean component structure and semantic HTML (`label`, `input`, `select`, etc.) for accessibility and maintainability.
