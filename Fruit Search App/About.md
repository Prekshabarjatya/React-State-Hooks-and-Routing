# About

I built **Fruit Search App** as part of my React learning journey. This project helped me practice important React concepts such as state management with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), handling user input, and working with external APIs.

In this app, I use a debounce strategy to limit API calls as the user types, fetch fruit data using `async/await`, and display search results dynamically. I also learned to handle errors gracefully and conditionally render UI content.

Building this app gave me hands-on experience with real-world patterns like debounced search and API integration. Itâ€™s a foundational project that prepared me for more complex React features and frontend challenges.
